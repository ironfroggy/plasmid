                <p><em>Plasmid makes it easy</em> to take advantage of storage browsers provide for our
web applications today.</p>

<p><em>Building offline first web apps is a breeze</em> with Plasmid.js, the javascript
library that makes the complicated details of IndexedDB under the hood and makes
it easy to build, utilize, and manage your browser-side databases.</p>

<p>But, <em>users don't live on one device</em> and the web thrives online. That's why
Plasmid was built from the ground up to support synroncizing these databases
with the Plasmid Sync server.</p>

    <h1>Plasmid.js</h1>

    <p>Plasmid.js makes working with browser-side storage easy. It eases the effort in working with the IndexedDB API across different browsers and devices.</p>

    <h1>Plasmid Sync</h1>

    <p>Plasmid Sync runs on your server and manages the updates from all the devices your users
    load your app on. It is not a backend data server, but only serves to syncronize the data
    between these devices, while the application continues to work completely on the device.</p>

<p><em>Together, Plasmid.js and Plasmid Sync</em> make building amazing, data-rich
web applications effortless. The pair are ideal for building web apps and web-based
installed applications. You can target all major platforms and users can enjoy
their data at their fingertips wherever they are.</p>
