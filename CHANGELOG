Release 0.1.3 - June 1, 2013
----------------------------

- Added start and stop parameters to walk and fetch methods.
  start is inclusive, stop is exclusive. Both take indexes to skip an offset and stop once
  a limit is hit.
- Added a reverse parameter to walk and fetch filters, which when true reverses the result order

Release 0.1.2 - May 30, 2013
----------------------------

Fixed a bug when calling walk() or fetch() without any filter value, or with an empty
object as a filter object. Can now use them in this way to walk or fetch all objects.

Release 0.1.1 - May 29, 2013
----------------------------

Fleshed out some basic test setup on the JS side, and cleaned up promises and filters.

- Deal with errors caused by invalid parameters opening a database, trigger errback
- Access an index wrapper by calling store.by(indexname). Indexes have the same API as stores,
  for reading.
- walk() no longer takes an index name
- walk() no longer results in an array, it only triggers each events on individual results
- fetch() captures all the results in an array
- walk() and fetch() take a filter value with gt (>), lt (<), gte (>=), or lte (<=) keys, or a
  combination, or a single value to filter equal to on the key or index.
- saving objects results in their (possibly randomized) key for retreival
- Added Promise.error() to set an error state on a promise
- Promises can only be resolved once, with ok() or error()
