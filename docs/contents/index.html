web applications today.</p>

<p><em>Building offline first web apps is a breeze</em> with Plasmid.js, the javascript

it easy to build, utilize, and manage your browser-side databases.</p>

<p>But, <em>users don't live on one device</em> and the web thrives online. That's why
Plasmid was built from the ground up to support synroncizing these databases
with the Plasmid Sync server.</p>

    <p>Plasmid Sync runs on your server and manages the updates from all the devices your users
    load your app on. It is not a backend data server, but only serves to syncronize the data
    between these devices, while the application continues to work completely on the device.</p>
